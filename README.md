# Handwriting Generation with RNN

This project implements an RNN-based model to generate handwriting-like text based on analyzed handwriting features from input images. The generated handwriting mimics the style of the input handwriting images.

## Features

- Preprocess handwriting images
- Extract handwriting features using the `handwriting-features` library
- Train an RNN model to generate handwriting
- Generate a transparent image with user-input text in the style of the input handwriting

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwriting-generation.git
cd handwriting-generation
```

##Install Dependencies

#Install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##Usage
#Preparing Handwriting Images

    Prepare your handwriting images and place them in the project directory.

    Update the image_paths variable in the script with the paths to your handwriting images.

##Running the Script

Run the script to process the handwriting images, train an RNN model, and generate a transparent image with user-input text in a handwriting-like style:

python handwriting_generation.py

# Example usage
```
image_paths = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg']
process_handwriting_images(image_paths, "Hello", 'output.png')

This will generate an image named output.png with the text "Hello" in the style of the input handwriting images.

##Notes

    Make sure you have the Arial font available on your system. The ImageFont.truetype function requires the path to the Arial font file (arial.ttf).
    Adjust the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training process based on your specific requirements.
    Optimize preprocessing and generation steps for faster performance if needed.
