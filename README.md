# Handwriting Generation with RNN

This project implements an RNN-based model to generate handwriting-like text based on analyzed handwriting features from input images. The generated handwriting mimics the style of the input handwriting images.

## Features

- Preprocess handwriting images
- Extract handwriting features using the `handwriting-features` library
- Train an RNN model to generate handwriting
- Generate a transparent image with user-input text in the style of the input handwriting

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwriting-generation.git
cd handwriting-generation

Create requirements.txt

Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:

opencv-python
numpy
pillow
handwriting-features
torch
torchvision

Install Dependencies

Install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt:

sh

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Preparing Handwriting Images

    Prepare your handwriting images and place them in the project directory.

    Update the image_paths variable in the script with the paths to your handwriting images.

Running the Script

Run the script to process the handwriting images, train an RNN model, and generate a transparent image with user-input text in a handwriting-like style:

sh

python handwriting_generation.py

Example

python

# Example usage
image_paths = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg']
process_handwriting_images(image_paths, "Hello", 'output.png')

This will generate an image named output.png with the text "Hello" in the style of the input handwriting images.
